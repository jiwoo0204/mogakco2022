            <p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard.
                I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.
                Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
                That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old,
                and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside. </p>
